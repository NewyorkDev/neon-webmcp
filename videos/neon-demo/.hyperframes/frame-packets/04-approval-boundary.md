- sfx: none

Adapt: keep the mirrored comparison signature, using PREPARED and BLOCKED as the two states, then preserve a long held proof state.

Scene 1 (0.0–4.0s): a prepared booking card enters from the left with Marco's portrait, Classic Cut, date, time, and $34 shown in a clean ledger; the heading AGENT PREPARES arrives above it.
Scene 2 (4.0–9.5s): an approval control enters from the right as the cursor attempts the final action (`cursor-click-ripple`); the control compresses (`physics-press-reaction`) but resolves to BLOCKED, CUSTOMER APPROVAL REQUIRED in coral.
Scene 3 (9.5–14.0s): both halves settle into a single statement, READY IS NOT APPROVED, with the blocked status retained and held completely still.

## Selected blueprint: comparison-split

# comparison-split — Comparison Split-Cards

**intent**: Two paired items of equal weight shown side-by-side with mirrored 3D "book-open" tilts — the eye reads them as a balanced comparison, then a pill badge lands at each card's inner edge to punctuate. The motion IS the symmetry: two cards arriving from opposite wings into a held spread.

**roles served**

- Key_Feature (from `comparison-split-cards`): when two complementary features / capabilities of equal weight should be presented **simultaneously, not sequentially** — an A/B, a "X + Y together," paired concepts the viewer must weigh side-by-side. Not for >2 items (use `grid-card-assemble`) or sequential steps.

**duration**: 4–6s

**shot structure** (a `[bg]` canvas carrying two faint ambient glow blooms — `[accent A]` near 30%, `[accent B]` near 70% — so each side owns a color identity across a 50% symmetry axis; equal-width cards under one shared perspective parent)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~0.8s) — title sets the concept.** A centered `[title line]` with an `[accent keyword]` slides DOWN into place from just above (a short smooth settle). The downward arrival is deliberate: it forms a non-conflicting T-shape against the cards, which arrive from the sides next.
- **Scene 2 (~0.4–1.9s) — the split-tilt entry (signature move).** Two equal-width feature cards arrive from opposite wings — `[left card]` from the left, `[right card]` from the right ~0.2s behind — each carrying a **mirrored 3D `rotateY` tilt** (left faces right, right faces left, opening like a book) and scaling ~0.85→1 as it lands. The entry overlaps the title's tail so the whole thing reads as ONE arrival, not two beats. Each card holds `[image / label / subtitle]`; box-shadows fall **outward** from the tilt (left shadow right, right shadow left).
- **Scene 3 (~1.9–end) — badges punctuate, then hold.** A pill `[badge]` lands at each card's **inner edge** (left then right, ~0.3s apart), overlapping its card ~15% so it reads as attached, not orbiting. This is the lone overshoot in the shot — it earns the punctuation. Settles and holds.

**motion vocabulary**: title slide-down from above; mirrored opposite-wing card entry; static book-open `rotateY` tilt (`+tilt` left, `−tilt` right); tilt-matched outward box-shadow; inner-edge badge spring-pop; gentle phase-opposed idle float (left vs right, never synchronized) registered as subtle jitter; dual side-glow ambient.

**rule mapping**

- two cards entering from opposite wings with mirrored `rotateY` tilts + tilt-matched shadow → `split-tilt-cards` (the signature; keep the two-layer split so the entry `x`/`scale` and the idle never collide on one alias)
- title slide-down settle → `gsap-effects` (translate + opacity on a long-tail `power3`)
- inner-edge pill badge pop (the one overshoot) → `spring-pop-entrance` (overshoot register — earns the punctuation)
- phase-opposed idle float on the pair → `sine-wave-loop` (low-amplitude register — subtle jitter, NOT lazy breathing; left `sin(t)`, right `sin(t+π)` so they never conveyor-belt)
- the two faint side glows behind the cards → `ambient-glow-bloom` (un-triggered soft bloom, one per accent)

**camera modifier**: camera-static by default — the symmetry is the subject and a move would break the balance.

## Selected motion rule: cursor-click-ripple

# Cursor Click Ripple

An animated cursor moves to a target element, performs a click with visual depression, and emits expanding ripple rings from the click point. Three sequential phases on one timeline: **move** (eased translation to the target's center) → **click** (scale depression on cursor + target together, yoyo back) → **ripple** (1–3 staggered rings expand and fade from the click point). This is a _point event at one location_ — a sustained hold across space is [cursor-drag.md](cursor-drag.md).

## Recipe

```html
<button class="target-button">{ctaLabel}</button>
<div class="cursor"><!-- arrow SVG, positioned at the entry corner --></div>
<!-- Rings live in DOM from t=0 at the click-target CENTER, scale 0 + opacity 0 -->
<div class="ripple ripple-1"></div>
<div class="ripple ripple-2"></div>
<div class="ripple ripple-3"></div>
```

```css
.ripple {
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%; /* click-target center */
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: 2px solid {rippleColor};
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(0);
  opacity: 0;
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

```js
// Phase 1 — Move: eased, not linear
tl.to(".cursor", { x: TARGET_X, y: TARGET_Y, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE }, 0);

// Phase 2 — Click: cursor + target depress together, then return
tl.to(
  ".cursor",
  { scale: CURSOR_PRESS_SCALE, duration: PRESS_DUR, ease: "power2.in", yoyo: true, repeat: 1 },
  CLICK_AT,
);
tl.to(
  ".target-button",
  { scale: TARGET_PRESS_SCALE, duration: PRESS_DUR, ease: "power2.in", yoyo: true, repeat: 1 },
  CLICK_AT,
);

// Phase 3 — Ripple burst, N rings staggered from the click point
tl.set([".ripple-1", ".ripple-2", ".ripple-3"], { opacity: 1 }, RIPPLE_AT);
tl.to(
  [".ripple-1", ".ripple-2", ".ripple-3"],
  {
    scale: RIPPLE_SCALE,
    opacity: 0,
    duration: RIPPLE_DUR,
    ease: RIPPLE_EASE,
    stagger: RIPPLE_STAGGER,
    immediateRender: false, // holds scale 0 / opacity 0 until the click moment
  },
  RIPPLE_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Single ring** — one `.ripple`, no stagger; more elegant when the rest of the scene is busy.
- **Keyframed attack-decay** — a `keyframes` block ramps opacity 0 → peak → 0 across the duration; a clearer "energy radiates and dissipates" envelope.
- **Multi-ring expanding pulse** — 3 rings at 0.08 s stagger when the click is the scene's climactic moment.

| RIPPLE_SCALE                | 3–6                         | 3 stays near the click site; if the ring would exit the frame before fading, lower it                                                  |
| RIPPLE_STAGGER              | 0.06–0.12 s (or 0)          | below ~0.06 s reads as one thick ring; above ~0.12 s as separate events                                                                |

Reference values: `../../examples/cta-orbit-collapse.html` — 0.5 s move on `back.out(1.3)`, click +0.2 s, press 0.08 s at 0.85/0.95, single ring to 5× over 0.7 s `power2.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **Move before click** — trigger the click only after the move tween settles; clicking mid-motion reads as unintentional.
- **Rings live in DOM from t=0** at the click-target center with `scale: 0` + `opacity: 0` — never conditionally rendered; `immediateRender: false` on the expand so they hold invisible until the trigger.
- **Ripple from the click point** — the button's visual center, not any element's bounding-box origin.
- **Synchronized depression** — cursor + target depress at the same position with the same duration, and both yoyo back.
- **Cursor above all content** (high z-index) for the whole sequence; `pointer-events: none` on cursor + ripples.

# Physics Press Reaction (Cursor + Element Synced)

Models a real click: a cursor approaches a button, lands, and both compress IN SYNC, then release together. Distinct from [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md) (no cursor — just a press happening); this rule is the COMBINED cursor + element behavior. A single `PRESS_INTENSITY` drives both: press down compresses both to `1 - PRESS_INTENSITY` via **one targets array**, release springs both back to 1.0 with overshoot. The cursor translates to the button's center BEFORE the press starts; after release it may move on or hold.

## Recipe

```html
<button class="btn" id="btn">{ctaCopy}</button>
<!-- Cursor at scene-root level so it translates freely; arrow TIP is the click
     point, so transform-origin: 0 0 — scaling around the tip keeps it stable. -->
<svg class="cursor" id="cursor" style="pointer-events: none; transform-origin: 0 0">…</svg>
```

```js
gsap.set("#cursor", { x: CURSOR_START_X, y: CURSOR_START_Y }); // off-screen / far corner

// Phase 1 — approach
tl.to(
  "#cursor",
  { x: BUTTON_CENTER_X, y: BUTTON_CENTER_Y, duration: APPROACH_DUR, ease: "power2.inOut" },
  APPROACH_START,
);

// Phase 2 — coordinated press down: ONE targets array, same scale
tl.to(
  ["#btn", "#cursor"],
  { scale: 1 - PRESS_INTENSITY, duration: PRESS_DOWN_DUR, ease: "power1.in" },
  PRESS_DOWN_AT,
);

// Phase 3 — release: both spring back together
tl.to(
  ["#btn", "#cursor"],
  { scale: 1, duration: RELEASE_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  RELEASE_AT,
);

// Phase 4 — inner glow during press, resting shadow on release (contact confirmation)
tl.to(
  "#btn",
  { boxShadow: "{btnPressedShadow}", duration: PRESS_DOWN_DUR, ease: "power1.in" },
  PRESS_DOWN_AT,
);
tl.to(
  "#btn",
  { boxShadow: "{btnRestingShadow}", duration: RELEASE_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  RELEASE_AT,
);

// Cursor optionally exits after the press settles
tl.to(
  "#cursor",
  { x: CURSOR_EXIT_X, y: CURSOR_EXIT_Y, duration: CURSOR_EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  CURSOR_EXIT_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Multiple-element chain press** — press button A → A triggers a swap → cursor moves to button B → presses again; each press is one full down-release sub-routine.
- **Hold press (continuous pressure)** — insert a `HOLD_DUR` window between press-down and release: both scales stay at `1 - PRESS_INTENSITY`, inner glow stays on. Suggests "thinking" or "loading."
- **Synchronized inner-glow pulse** — during the hold, pulse the inset glow with a sine driver: a `{ p: 0 }` proxy tweened to `Math.PI * GLOW_PULSE_CYCLES * 2` on `ease: "none"`, `onUpdate` writing `boxShadow` with `alpha = GLOW_BASE_ALPHA + sin(p) * GLOW_PULSE_AMP`. Suggests "processing."

## Critical Constraints

- **Same press scale on cursor AND button** (one targets array) — only the button scaling makes the cursor "tap on air"; only the cursor scaling makes the button feel disconnected.
- **Cursor arrives BEFORE the press starts** — a clear "cursor over target" moment, or the press is unattributed.
- **`back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` on the release, for both together** — a linear release loses the tactile feel; release MUST come after press.
- **Inner glow appears DURING press, fades on release** — outer shadow shrinks (pushed in), inner glow appears (energy concentrated).
- **Cursor `transform-origin: 0 0`** — the arrow's tip is the click point; scale around the tip keeps it stable. `pointer-events: none` on the cursor.
- **Climax dwell ≥ 1 s** — after release the composition must continue ≥ 1 s; the press is a beat, the viewer needs time to see the result.
- **No real `mouseenter` / `click` events** — HF is a render context; everything runs via the timeline.
